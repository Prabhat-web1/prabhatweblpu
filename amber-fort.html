            <p>Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort, is a marvelous palace situated on the sides of Aravalli Hills near Jaipur, Rajasthan and is around 11 kilometers away from it. It was developed during the late 16th century by Raja Man Singh I. This site has been declared to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its inimitable amalgamation of Hindu and Mughal designs in architecture. The fort is well-known for its beautiful and intricate design with great red sandstone and marble buildings, carvings, and frescoes. Some of the most prominent attractions of this place are the Sheesh Mahal, or Mirror Palace, that reflects light from thousands of tiny mirrors and creates a view which is breath-taking, or other courtyards, gardens, and palaces showing the magnificence of the Rajput era</p><br>
            <p>The strategic location is one of the reasons, but it offers a sight for the eyes of a stunning landscape and Maota Lake, which adds to the beauty of the place. Amber Fort is not only an historical landmark but also a hub for tourists who are fascinated by its rich heritage and also elephant rides, a beautiful light and sound presentation depicting its glorious past. This is the symbol of Rajasthan's rich heritage because it provides architectural brilliance and historical significance, with the culture and artistry of its time.
