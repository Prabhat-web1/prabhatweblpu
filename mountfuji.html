                <li>Accessing Mount Fuji
                    Mount Fuji is located on the border between Yamanashi and Shizuoka Prefectures in Japan. It is easily accessible from Tokyo, with transport options including trains (from Shinjuku or Tokyo Station to Kawaguchiko Station) and buses.
                    
                    2. Climbing Mount Fuji
                    The primary season for climbing Mount Fuji is during the summer months, typically early July to early September. Outside of this period, climbing is not recommended due to snow and extreme weather conditions.
                    
                    Climbing Season:
                    Start: Early July
                    End: Early September
                    Climbing Routes: There are four main climbing routes to the summit: Yoshida, Subashiri, Gotemba, and Fujinomiya.
                    3. Climbing Fees
                    To climb Mount Fuji, you generally need to pay a climbing fee for the maintenance of the mountain and to support its infrastructure.
                    
                    Climbing Fee: The climbing fee is typically ¥1,000 - ¥1,500 per person, depending on the route and whether you are using facilities like mountain huts. The fee is mainly used for cleaning and maintaining the climbing trails, rest areas, and other amenities.
                    4. Visiting Mount Fuji (Non-Climbing Activities)
                    If you are not planning to hike to the summit but want to visit Mount Fuji for sightseeing or enjoy views from the surrounding areas (such as Fuji Five Lakes or the Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station), the costs are different.
                    
                   <li> Key Viewing Spots:
                    Fifth Station:
                    The Fifth Station (Subaru Line 5th Station) is a popular spot for tourists who want to enjoy views of Mount Fuji without climbing. It sits at around 2,300 meters and offers breathtaking views of the mountain and the surrounding landscape. You can drive or take a bus to this point.
                    Entry Fee to Fifth Station: There is no specific entry fee for visitors to the Subaru Line 5th Station, but there may be parking fees.
                    Parking Fees: Around ¥500 - ¥1,000 per vehicle at some stations.
                    Fuji Five Lakes (Fujigoko Area):
                    Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Saiko, Lake Shoji, Lake Motosu: These lakes offer excellent views of Mount Fuji. You can enjoy boating, hiking, and photography with the mountain as a backdrop.
                    Activities: Some lakes offer additional activities like boat rentals (approx. ¥1,000-¥2,000 for boat rentals) and hiking trails (free or minimal entry fees).
                    Mount Fuji World Heritage Center:
                    Mount Fuji World Heritage Center in Fujiyoshida offers exhibits and information about the history and cultural significance of Mount Fuji.

                    5. Best Time to Visit
                    Climbing: The best time to climb Mount Fuji is during the official climbing season, from early July to early September.
                    Sightseeing: For sightseeing and photography, the months of May to October are ideal when the weather is clear and pleasant. Winter months can be cold and snowy, which may hinder accessibility to the summit and certain areas.
                    6. Other Costs
                    Guided Tours: If you're interested in guided hiking tours, prices can range from ¥10,000 to ¥30,000 depending on the type of tour and services offered (such as meals, accommodations, etc.).
                    Mountain Huts: If you're climbing and want to stay at a mountain hut on Mount Fuji, the fees for staying overnight are approximately ¥5,000 - ¥10,000 per person.
                    7. Weather and Safety
                    Be sure to check weather forecasts before your trip. Mount Fuji’s weather can change rapidly, and altitude sickness is a concern for those climbing.
                    If you plan to hike, make sure to be well-prepared with appropriate gear and check the condition of the trails and mountain huts in advance.
